run run_bo.sh with the name of a function:


bash run_bo.sh square_sin


You need two files: {name}_history.txt and {name}_next.txt

To start, history is like this:

2
0,5
0,6

This means "2 variables, range from 0-5"


To start, square_sin_next is 0,0

That means input values are 0.

Attempts will be appended.
